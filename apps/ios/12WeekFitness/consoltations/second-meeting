1. Splash Screen

2. First would be motivational statements in the center, and then all the different information that they've already accomplished for the day.  But for the phone it can't be too much information because then people can get lost.

(It would be kind of cool, if you can scroll up and then have everything blur)  - Make it easier to navigate.  Even if it's not easier to navigate just make it visually comfortable.

What did you want initially?

- Have the ability to have a day 1, day 2, etc.  
- It opens up and a person is able to take a picture of themselves.  
- Put their weight, put their height.  We don't have to put measurements, but you could have it on there.  - Measurements would be good. (optional) -

- Maybe instead of motivational text being there, showing their progress instead.  
- Right now everything works, but it's just kind of ugly.  
- Maybe figure something besides buttons, just make something real clean, that makes you feel like you're in a new operating system I guess.  Possibly have some layers to it.

Every four weeks, be able to show the difference of what you've done.  Or every week.  The app that he uses right now is a weight tracker.  (You could make it so that they could enter in the information any time that they want)

Splash Screen:

Screen 1:

	Status for Work Out

	Work Out

	View Calendar

App won't be running all the time.

Screen 2:

App needs a timer.  Specifically for cardio or for work outs.  A lot of people when doing sets will do 12, and then have a rest time for maybe a minute.  60 or 30 seconds (maybe they can set it themselves) - You press once - 30 seconds (every time you add 30 seconds)

30 60 90

Screen Calendar:

- Calendar as a choice (if they want) - when a person did notes on that page you could see little color selections showing that there were notes on that day.  Don't need x's over the entire day, you could just do little exes in the corner of each day.  Just something that kind of shows that the day was completed.

- If you chose three day, it changes back to a green x.  Obviously that doesn't need to be there.  
- Something showing that you did not succeed that day.  Figure out a way to do that.  
- On days that you worked out, you can touch them, and can display what they did, then they can edit it, if they chose, but you need to press something to edit that.

See the month view, touch it, it pops up, then you chose edit that day, and you can edit it.

Screen Cardio:

Cardio days:  Used to be a dial, may just be plusses and minus buttons, not even really sure.  Anything for cardio is good.  

- An actual timer is good.  A timer would be good.  Tell you what you have left.  
- 30 mins of cardio left (voice).  
- Doesn't stop music, but you can have it go off like every thirty minutes or something.  
- It's very important to hear that you have 1 minute left.

- User can have either a timer that counts down with an actual voice.  That says something every five minutes.  
- You must be able to silence it.  They can listen to anything and it can still work!
- Add pausing feature
	- Two buttons pop up: Continue - Save - Store Cardio for that day right then 

- Save the time stamp of what time you worked out
- Email more than just one day, email as many days as you want.

Screen Back up:

- Picture that you took of yourself, your weight and measurements.  A basic outline of what you did.  
- Select the days that you want to see
- Make it digitally appealing

Screen 3:

- A Tutorial, a live tutorial - You can skip if you want.
- Make it more appealing to do the work.  The app right now is very confusing, which is very true.
- Do 150 pounds, you simply entered it in.
- Some people have specific routines that they do.  It'd be good if when a person chooses a workout, they can select previous workout.  Then it would just go right to what they did before.
- Bottom of the screen has types of workouts that a person can do.
- Go work out - have choices, upper body, cardio, lower body free day

- He prefers images, flat images, not real people, no color involved, but just a stenciil of it.

A lot of people were requesting notes.  People like to have notes on their daily excercises.

Screen Day View - Select your time:

Lower Body
Upper Body
Cardio
Free Day

If they do 290 squats, and then they did 285 the next week, then they could write that down.  You can have daily notes.  If they did squats that day, and then notes was under squats, then under the daily squats it could show the notes that they left themselves.

It will be day by day
